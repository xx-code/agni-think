# üì¶ Agni

> A personal finance tracking app to visualize your spending habits and raise awareness about your financial behavior.

This project is an application designed to help you track your expenses, analyze your financial behavior through graphs, and develop better money habits. It offers semi-automated features, and future versions will include AI and workflow automation.

To get the most out of this tool, treat it like a financial notebook consistent usage is key to long-term insight and improvement.

## üî• Why the Name "Agni"?

In my culture, the Agni ethnic group is often stereotyped as stingy. However, I believe that being "stingy" isn't necessarily a bad trait as long as it doesn't lead to a miserable lifestyle. Instead, it can be a mindset focused on financial health and responsibility. I see it as being economical and intentional with money.

## üìê Stack

**Frontend**  
- Vue.js with Nuxt (migrating from React)

**Backend**  
- Node.js with Express  
- Database handled using Knex

**Mobile**  
- Swift with SwiftUI (coming soon)

**Monorepo**  
- Turborepo (not yet implemented)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The backend (Node.js + Express) follows **Clean Architecture** principles combined with a **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** approach for modeling business logic.

apps/
    agni-server/ # Backend server
    config/             # Configuration files and dependency injection container # Includes environment setup, constants, and app-wide settings
    controllers/        # HTTP controllers or interfaces to execute use cases # Responsible for parsing requests, calling use cases, and formatting responses
    core/               # The heart of the application (domain and use cases)
      adapters/         # Interface adapters to connect the domain with external systems or frameworks# Example: data mappers, serializers, or gateways
      domains/          # Pure domain logic ‚Äî no framework or DB logic here # Includes: # - Entities (business objects with identity) # - Value Objects (immutable, behavior-driven types) # - Domain services (pure logic with no side-effects)
      interactions/     # Application-level use cases # Defines how the outside world interacts with domain logic # Example: "CreateTransaction", "GenerateSpendingReport"
      repositories/     # Interfaces that define how to interact with data sources # These are implemented later in the infrastructure layer
    infra/              # Infrastructure implementations for external services
                        # Includes:
                        # - Database adapters (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite)
                        # - External APIs
                        # - Repository implementations that fulfill `core/repositories` interfaces
    agni-web/ # Frontend web application (Nuxt.js), Handles all user interface and client-side logic
    
    agni-mobile/ # Mobile app (Swift + SwiftUI, coming soon); # Will share logic where possible with agni-web

2. To build for production:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  npm run start
  ```
3. For Docker:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d --build
  ```

### Access
After deployment, the backend server is available on the configured port (default 5002), and the frontend on port 3000.

### Update
To update, pull the repository and rerun the build/start commands.
