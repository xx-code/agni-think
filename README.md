# üì¶ Agni

> A personal finance tracking app to visualize your spending habits and raise awareness about your financial behavior.

This project is an application designed to help you track your expenses, analyze your financial behavior through graphs, and develop better money habits. It offers semi-automated features, and future versions will include AI and workflow automation.

To get the most out of this tool, treat it like a financial notebook consistent usage is key to long-term insight and improvement.

## üî• Why the Name "Agni"?

In my culture, the Agni ethnic group is often stereotyped as stingy. However, I believe that being "stingy" isn't necessarily a bad trait as long as it doesn't lead to a miserable lifestyle. Instead, it can be a mindset focused on financial health and responsibility. I see it as being economical and intentional with money.

## üìê Stack

**Frontend**  
- Vue.js with Nuxt (migrating from React)

**Backend**  
- Node.js with Express  
- Database handled using Knex

**Mobile**  
- Swift with SwiftUI (coming soon)

**Monorepo**  
- Turborepo (not yet implemented)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The backend (Node.js + Express) follows **Clean Architecture** principles combined with a **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** approach for modeling business logic.
